### Manual Testing:

-Manual testing occured on the ionic serve on the laptop. With updates to the structure of the database. 

-The new event system was checked to see if it could correctly distinguish specific events from others. 

-Being able to search went ok but reseting the initilised array failed.

-Manual testing revealed there was a problem when creating events when no data was put into a field. We decided to put in a test to throw a error message to user if no data inputted into the compulsory field. 
 


### Application Testing:

-All testing on the application was manual. The manual testing occured on 3 different devices, an emulator iOS device and android device through ionic serve, a Samsung S8 and a vodfone d600 phone.

-Today the camera on the application was tested. The camera was checked to see if it could successfully capture an image in different situations.

-The scanner passed all tests with scanning qr codes. 


-The camera passed the test of saving the images locally on the android devices when adding a picture.The camera did not pass the test of uploading images to the database although this was expected as was not linked to the path of the image when using firebase snapshot.

-All other pages in the app which were running and useable were manually tested and all working correctly.
